These are some steps and important links for you to help with the topics we have discussed in today's session

discussed with example how to pass data between components using angular routing add following to app-routing.module.ts file

{ path: 'employees/:guy', component: EmployeesComponent },

route to the specified link with data attached to it as uri params

<button routerLink="/employees/{{namevariable}}">Route</button> 
<!---- or ---->
<button routerLink="/employees/Martin">Route</button>

and to capture the route parameter data using ActivatedRoute, add the following to contructor and ngOnInit functions

import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) { } 

ngOnInit(): void {    
	this.route.params.subscribe(response =>{      
	// this.fetchedName = paramdata['guy'];      
	this.fetchedName = response.guy;      
	console.log(this.fetchedName);    
	});  
	// our global variable 
	fetchedName;

discussed how to redirect routes in case of incorrect path
{ path: 'fist', redirectTo: '/first' },

discussed how to create wild card routes in case of unknown route links  
{ path: '**', component: PagenotfoundComponent }

Please try to complete the application (we have started today) before our next session. It will help you apply each concept we discussed through this whole week. I will also provide a url to studentsdata(array object) we have created today which you can use for the assignment project. 

Also, please keep in touch in case you have any queries regarding the concepts discussed in any session so far.
